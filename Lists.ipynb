(You can verify this by calling `help(list.index)`.) So if, after sorting the list in ascending order, the value 0 is at index 0, then the number of negatives is 0. If 0 is at index 2 (i.e. the third element), then there are two elements smaller than 0. And so on.\n\n*Note*: it's usually considered \"impolite\" to modify a list that someone passes to your function without giving them some warning (i.e. unless the docstring says that it modifies its input). So, if we wanted to be nice, we could have started by making a copy of nums using the `list.copy()` method (e.g. `our_nums = nums.copy()`), and then working with that copy rather than the original.\n\nIf you're a big Lisp fan, you might have written this technically compliant solution (we haven't talked about recursion, but I guess this doesn't use any syntax or functions we haven't seen yet...):\n\n```python\ndef count_negatives(nums):\n    # Equivalent to \"if len(nums) == 0\". An empty list is 'falsey'.\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n    else:\n        # Implicitly converting a boolean to an int!

First, you'll need to save a version of your notebook that shows your current work by hitting the \"Commit & Run\" button. (Your work is saved automatically, but versioning your work lets you go back and look at what it was like at the point you saved it. It also let's you share a nice compiled notebook instead of just the raw code.) Then, once your notebook is finished running, you can go to the Settings tab in the panel to the left (you may have to expand it by hitting the [<] button next to the \"Commit & Run\" button) and setting the \"Visibility\" dropdown to \"Public\".\n\n# Keep Going\n\nWhen you're ready to continue, [click here](https://www.kaggle.com/colinmorris/loops-and-list-comprehensions) to continue on to the next tutorial on loops and list comprehensions."
